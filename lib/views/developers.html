            <p>Whisper.ws is an app, but also a platform. We are currently in beta of our developer API / SDK's which are now available for evaluation. We'd love for you to build on top of whisper.ws for any scenario where one-time URL's would be valuable. We recently published a Node.js SDK and will soon document our REST API's.</p>  
            <h4 > Node.js </h4>
            <p>Our Node.js library can be downloaded / contributed to / forked over at github. Go grab it <a href="https://github.com/lawrips/whisper">here</a>.</p>                
            <p> We've published the whisper.ws Node.js SDK to npm to make it easy to download (available <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/whisper-ws">here</a>). Installation is easy, as simple as:</p>
            <pre> npm install --save whisper-ws</pre>
            <p> Usage of the SDK is quite straightforward:</p>
<pre>
var Whisper = require('whisper-ws')
var whisper = new Whisper({"token": "Ngb1yfg!gbakeIgbE3!ngjqugBhHgfqe"}); // this is a real token you can use for evaluation 
whisper.set('my secret text', (err, result) => {
    if (err) console.log(err);
    console.log(result);
});
</pre>            
            <p> Similarly, getting a secret only requires a couple of lines of code: </p>                
<pre>
whisper.set('my secret text', (err, result) => {
    if (err) console.log(err);
    console.log(result);
    whisper.get(result.key, (err, result) => {
        if (err) console.log(err);
        console.log(result);
    });
});
</pre>
            <p> Head on over to <a href="https://github.com/lawrips/whisper">https://github.com/lawrips/whisper</a> for the full documentation. </p> 
            <h4> Console app </h4>
            <p> Included in the whisper-ws npm module is also a console app which allows for easy access to whisper.ws from the command line.</p> 
            <p> To install the console app, install whisper-ws globally using npm: </p>
            <pre> npm install -g whisper-ws </pre>
            <p> Once installed, the following options are enabled:</p>
<pre>
Options: 
-h, --help                 output usage information
-f, --file [file]          the filename to send to whisper.ws
-t, --text [text]          provide a string rather than a file
-u, --url [url]            optional: overrides destination server (developers only)
-e, --encoding [encoding]  optional: specifies encoding (default is utf-8)
</pre>

            <p>
            <h4> Account / token </h4>
            <p> This whisper-ws SDK comes with a token included. This can be found in the file ./config/whisper.json after installing or from github. This is rate limited by IP address and will allow for basic testing. Scale / production use is coming soon. For more details, contact us at at our <b><a href="/contact">contact page</a></b>.
            <p>
